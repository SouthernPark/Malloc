Because we find a matched space in the linkedlist, we now have to give the    
space the user requested. Here are two cases:                                 
    1. After we split the node, the rest of the space is too small to record  
       In this situation, we just give the user the whole space, which means  
       We do not split the node.                                              
    2. Else the rest of the node is still very big, we can split the node     
       And set the rest of the node as available.
